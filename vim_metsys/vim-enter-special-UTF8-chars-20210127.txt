Inserting special UTF-8 chars:

By character value

It is also possible to enter any character (which can be displayed in your current 'encoding'), even a character for which no digraph is defined, if you know the character value, as follows (where ^V means "hit Ctrl-V, except if you use Ctrl-V to paste, in which case you should hit Ctrl-Q instead):

    By decimal value: ^Vnnn (with 000 <= nnn <= 255)
    By octal value: ^VOnnn or ^Vonnn (with 000 <= nnn <= 377)
    By hex value: ^VXnn or ^Vxnn (with 00 <= nn <= FF)
    By hex value for BMP Unicode codepoints: ^Vunnnn (with 0000 <= nnnn <= FFFF)
    By hex value for any Unicode codepoint: ^VUnnnnnnnn (with 00000000 <= nnnnnnnn <= 7FFFFFFF)

for example a right-triangle-filled-big: <ctrl-v>u25b6 --> "â–¶"
