vim issues warning:
	Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal

if command:
	$> find . | fzf | xargs vim

... and then terminal stops working correctly!

Solution:
	The reason this is happening is that xargs is not opening your tty in the child process. You need to add
	the -o option in xargs for "open tty". This runs stty sane connected to your terminal. So the correct
	command is:
	$> find . | fzf |xargs -o vim
