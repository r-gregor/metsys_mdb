Scrolling in Vim makes background disappear

Hello !

Scrolling in Vim makes the background color of Vim disappear, and the background color of the terminal
is used instead.

The black is really the background color of the terminal and not some default OpengGL black (I've tested
with another color).

OS is Linux Manjaro XFCE (latest version, stable branch, everything up-to-date). Kitty was downloaded
through the AUR and its version is the latest one (0.2.7).

Add the following to your .vimrc

" vim hardcodes background color erase even if the terminfo file does
" not contain bce (not to mention that libvte based terminals
" incorrectly contain bce in their terminfo files). This causes
" incorrect background rendering when using a color theme with a
" background color.
let &t_ut=''

Incidentally, the latest version of kitty is 0.2.8
And just as a bonus tip, if you want to make vim more efficient, use the following

" General colors
if has('gui_running') || has('nvim')
	hi Normal        guifg=#f6f3e8 guibg=#242424
else
	" Set the terminal default background and foreground colors, thereby
	" improving performance by not needing to set these colors on empty cells.
	hi Normal guifg=NONE guibg=NONE ctermfg=NONE ctermbg=NONE
	let &t_ti = &t_ti . "\033]10;#f6f3e8\007\033]11;#242424\007"
	let &t_te = &t_te . "\033]110\007\033]111\007"
endif

Obviously change the colors in the above to match your color scheme.
