apt clean
The apt clean command is useful for removing file contents from the local package cache directory
(/var/cach/apt/archives) and not only this, but it is also very useful for removing packages that were
interrupted during installation or upgrade.

apt autoclean
It is also similar to apt clean the only difference that it only removes the obsolete version of the cache
file, which is no longer available in the repository due to a higher version of the application being
available.

apt autoremove
When you run apt autoremove, it will remove all the dependencies that have been installed during the
installation of packages but are no longer needed by any other installed packages.
