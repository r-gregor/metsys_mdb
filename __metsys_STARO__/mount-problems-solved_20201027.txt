Same experience after adding this line
UUID=F43A-5DF2 /mnt/NASRPI exfat uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=007 0 0
with:
sudo nano /etc/fstab
to
/etc/fstab

My Raspberry is not booting anymore !!
New image of raspbian stretch was necessary !!

You need to add the [nofail] options if you want to automount external devices with fstab. You can use the
ArchWiki like a Linux guide. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/fstab#External_devices

That happened to me aswell. Luckily I had another Pi and an external SD card reader so I put the "dead" SD
card into the other Pi and removed the offending fstab line. There is an option that can be added so the Pi
continues the boot process after 90 seconds even if the mount can't be done.

UUID=CA74-83DD /mnt/usb vfat uid=1000,gid=1000,nofail,umask=007 0 0

Totally the same experience. Followed this Pi wouldn't boot. Used this in /etc/fstab instead:

/dev/sda1 /media/USBdrive ext4 defaults,nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=1,noatime 0 0

and it works a charm. Note of course that I formatted my USB drive ext4, as it's a permanent fixture with my
pi and I have no need or desire to move it, and even if I did, well my whole home LAN is Linux based and
I got no probs with ext4 format drives.
