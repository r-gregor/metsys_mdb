1 - update/upgrade RPi-server
	>sudo apt-get update
	>sudo apt-get upgrade

2 - install CUPS on RPi-server
	>sudo apt-get install cups
	>sudo usermod -a -G lpadmin pi
	
	>sudo cp /etc/cups/cupsd.conf /etc/cups/cupsd.conf.ORIGINAL
	>sudo vim /etc/cups/cupsd.conf ...
		# Listen localhost:631
		Listen *:631
	
	>sudo cupsctl --remote-admin
	>sudo cupsctl --remote-any
	>sudo /etc/init.d/cups restart

3 - add printer on clients
	browser: https://<RPi-server-ip-address>:631 ...
		Don't worry about the certificate warning. It's self signed so your browser will rightfully
		warn you about it. Now click on Administration and then on Add Printer. You should be prompted
		with a user and password. Of course, use "pi" as the user and "raspberry" as the password
		(or whatever new password you chose). You should see a list of local printers. Press continue,
		review the information and make sure you check "Share this printer". Choose a make and model
		and finally add the printer.
		
4 - install scanner on RPi-server
	>scanimage -L	# test if sane is installed (usually with CUPS)
	>scanimage --format=tiff > ~/myimage.tiff 	# test if scanner works
	>sudo cp /etc/sane.d/saned.conf /etc/sane.d/saned.conf.ORIGINAL
	>sudo vim /etc/sane.d/saned.conf
		192.168.1.0/24				# add this line
	
	>sudo cp /etc/default/saned /etc/default/saned.ORIGINAL
	>sudo vim /etc/default/saned			# make sure SANE starts by default
		RUN=yes					# change this line to yes

	### IMPORTANT add saned to group "lp" and reboot:
	>sudo usermod -a -G saned


5 - add printer to clients
	>sudo apt-get update
	>sudo apt-get install hplip
		Then navigate to System settings --> Printers (or search for "printers"), and then select Add
		printer. Your computer should automatically detect the printer shared by the print server over
		the network. Click next and follow the steps to add the printer - you will be asked to add the
		driver like you did in CUPS. When you are finished, click Maintenance --> Print Test Page to
		check everything works as expected.
		
5 - add scanner to clients		
	>sudo apt-get update
	>sudo apt-get install xsane skanlite
	
	>sudo cp /etc/sane.d/net.conf /etc/sane.d/net.conf.ORIGINAL
	>vim /etc/sane.d/net.conf
		connect_timeout = 60			# uncomment this line
		192.168.1.XX				# add RPi-server-ip-address to file

		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONALLY

6 - install zeroconf
	>sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
	>sudo insserv avahi-daemon			# make sure it is start as a server
	>sudo nano /etc/avahi/services/multiple.service
		Now just make sure the server also knows what to advertise. This is defined in an XML file.
		A simple example would be:
			<?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?>
			<!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd">
			<service-group>
			<name replace-wildcards="yes">%h</name>
			<service>
			<type>_device-info._tcp</type>
			<port>0</port>
			<txt-record>model=RaspberryPi</txt-record>
			</service>
			<service>
			type>_ssh._tcp</type>
			port>22</port>
			</service>
			</service-group>
		
		You should now be able to refer to your Raspberry Pi by its ZeroConfig network name. That is
		always the machine name (hostname) plus the extension “.local”. So the complete name, if you
		didn’t change the host name, should be “hostname.local”.

	>sudo apt-get install avahi-utils
	>avahi-browse -at
			At the very least, this enables you to see if other ZeroConfig service announcements
			can be seen from this machine by entering: avahi-browse -at
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
7 - change the hostname
	>sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.ORIGINAL
	>sudo vim /etc/hosts
		127.0.1.1	<new hostname = malina1>

	>sudo cp /etc/hostname /etc/hostname.ORIGINAL
	>sudo vim /etc/hostname
		# raspberrypi --> change to:
		malina1
		
	>/etc/init.d/hostname.sh			# commit the changes (or reboot)
