Setup Inconsolata font on ubuntu:

Ubuntu 14.04 - Install Inconsolata Monospace Font

Inconsolata is a monospace font that still manages to look good in Netbeans on Linux even with the font hinting issues that the application has (and without having to install font-infinality or changing your JRE).

Please note that the font does not have that spacing between lines by default, I edited Netbeans configuration to increase the line spacing.
Steps
sudo apt-get install fonts-inconsolata -y
sudo fc-cache -fv
