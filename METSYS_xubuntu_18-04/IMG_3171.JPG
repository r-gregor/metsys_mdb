Instructions

Install Prerequisites
   Let's start by the installation of all prerequisites:
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libgconf-2-4

Download Popcorn Time binaries
   In this section we will download and extract Popcorn Time binaries into the /opt/popcorn-time
   directory:
$ sudo mkdir /opt/popcorn-time

   Next, download and extract popcorn-time:
FOR 32-BIT SYSTEM EXECUTE:
$ sudo wget -O- https://get.popcorntime.sh/build/Popcorn-Time-0.3.10-Linux-32.tar.xz | sudo tar Jx -C /opt/popcorn-time

FOR 64-BIT SYSTEM EXECUTE:
$ sudo wget -O- https://get.popcorntime.sh/build/Popcorn-Time-0.3.10-Linux-64.tar.xz | sudo tar Jx -C /opt/popcorn-time

   Give it some time. Depending on your internet speed the download may take some time.

Create executable link
   Now, that Popcorn Time binaries are installed, we will create a symbolic link of the
   /opt/popcorn-time/Popcorn-Time binary to /usr/bin/popcorn-time. This will allow non-privileged users
   to start Popcorn Time via terminal without any additional configuration:
$  sudo ln -sf /opt/popcorn-time/Popcorn-Time /usr/bin/popcorn-time

Create Desktop Launcher
   Open up terminal and use your favorite text editor (eg. vim) and create the launcher shortcut.
   The below command uses the vim editor to create the new /usr/share/applications/popcorntime.desktop
   desktop entry:
$ sudo nano /usr/share/applications/popcorntime.desktop

   Insert the following content into the above created file:
[Desktop Entry]
Version = 1.0
Type = Application
Terminal = false
Name = Popcorn Time
Exec = /usr/bin/popcorn-time
Icon = /opt/popcorn-time/popcorntime.png
Categories = Application;

   Lastly, download the Popcorn Time's icon:
$ sudo wget -qO /opt/popcorn-time/popcorntime.png goo.gl/wz8ifr

   Search Activities menu to start Popcorn Time. Accept License.
