sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

Scroll all the way to the bottom of the file and add one, or both of the following snippets.
Depending on whether you want to set a static IP address for a wired connection or a wireless
connection eth0 = wired, wlan0 = wireless.

Youâ€™ll need to edit the numbers in the snippet so they match your network configuration.

<code>
interface eth0

static ip_address=192.168.64.33/24
static routers=192.168.64.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.64.1
</code>
