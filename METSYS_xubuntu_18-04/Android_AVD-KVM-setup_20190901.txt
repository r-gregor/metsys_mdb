Android: AVD KVM setup 20190901

I believe you are trying to run AVD on Linux machine in KVM mode(called HAXM on Windows and OS X machines)

Install KVM by executing following command

$ sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libvirt-bin virtinst bridge-utils cpu-checker

Next check KVM installed successfully by executing following command

$ kvm-ok

the output will be something like this

INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used

Next add your username to KVM and libvirtd and run the AVD from the tools directory of your android SDK

$sudo adduser `id -un` libvirtd	(libvirt ??)
$sudo adduser `id -un` kvm

$ ./emulator64-x86 -avd < your AVD name> -qemu -m 2047 -enable-kvm

Note: To find the names of your available AVDs, open the AVD manager from tools folder of android sdk by executing command $./android avd
