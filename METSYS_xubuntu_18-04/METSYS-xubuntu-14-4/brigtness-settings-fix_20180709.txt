No Brightness settins fix --> it is contained in xfce4-power-manager:
	sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop 
...doesn't install package xfce4-power-manager. So installing this package helped me to solve this problem:

1-install
	sudo apt-get install xfce4-power-manager xfce4-power-manager-data xfce4-power-manager-plugins
Next reboot your laptop and enjoy it.

2-add to top pannel (brightness plugin is awailable as items that can be added)
