   Although this method works just fine, it is more reliable and efficient
   to use a handy script called “byobu” that combines all the commands
   above into a single program with useful options such as specifying
   number of kernels to keep on the system.

   Install byobu script package which provides a program called
   purge-old-kernels used for removing old kernels and header packages
   from the system.
$ sudo apt install byobu

   Then remove old kernels like so (the command below allows 2 kernels to
   be kept on the system).
$ sudo purge-old-kernels --keep 2
