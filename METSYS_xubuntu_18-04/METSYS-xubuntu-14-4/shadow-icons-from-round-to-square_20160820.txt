Note: The Places icons are round by default, if you want to replace them with Square Places then run following commands:
Terminal Commands:
sudo mv /usr/share/icons/Shadow/scalable/places /usr/share/icons/Shadow/scalable/round_places
sudo mv /usr/share/icons/Shadow/scalable/square_places /usr/share/icons/Shadow/scalable/places

If you want to revert back to Round Places then run following commands:
Terminal Commands:
sudo mv /usr/share/icons/Shadow/scalable/places /usr/share/icons/Shadow/scalable/square_places
sudo mv /usr/share/icons/Shadow/scalable/round_places /usr/share/icons/Shadow/scalable/places

That's it


sudo mv /usr/share/icons/Shadow/scalable/places /usr/share/icons/Shadow/scalable/round_places && sudo mv /usr/share/icons/Shadow/scalable/square_places /usr/share/icons/Shadow/scalable/places
