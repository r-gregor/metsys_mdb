How To Find Out Linux Operating System (OS) Installation Date And Time?
August 13, 2019

   You may curious to know when the Linux Operating System (OS) was installed on your machine.

   It could be various reason. But recently i had a requirement to find out this information.

   The requirement is, we need to decommission few of our servers which we built long time back for
   different project requirement.

   Due to some reason those project didn't happen but we would like to know when it was built before
   proceeding the decommission.

   However, these commands are not worked for me because the server was built from a template.

   Make a note, if you installed a operating system from template then it will show you the template
   built date and not for actual OS installed date.

   If the machine was not installed from template then it will work as expected.

   There are three standard ways that we can check this. We will show you one by one.

   Also, rpm based systems has their own commands to check this, i will include those as well.
     * tune2fs Command: adjust tunable filesystem parameters on ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems.
     * dumpe2fs Command: dump ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem information.
     * ls Command: ls command is used to list the directory contents.
     * basesystem Command: dump ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem information.
     * setup Command: The setup package contains a set of important system configuration and setup
       files, such as passwd, group, and profile.
     * setuptool Command: Setuptool is a user-friendly text mode menu utility which allows you to access
       all of the text mode configuration programs included in the operating system distribution.

Method-1: How To Find Out Linux Operating System (OS) Installation Date And Time Using tune2fs Command?
   The tune2fs command allows the system administrator to adjust various tunable filesystem parameters
   on Linux ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystems.

   First we need to identify the device name of the /
   partition. It can be done in many ways but i prefer to go with df Command.
# df -P /

Filesystem                      1024-blocks    Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/mapper/vg_2daygeek-lv_root    27228028 5319516  21630588      20% /

   Then run the tune2fs command to find out Linux Operating System (OS) Installation Date And Time.
# tune2fs -l /dev/mapper/vg_2daygeek-lv_root | grep 'Filesystem created:'

Filesystem created:       Fri Jun 29 22:15:34 2018

   Use the following combination to check Linux Operating System (OS) Installation Date And Time in
   single command.
# baseos=$(df -P / | tail -1 | cut -d" " -f1) && tune2fs -l $baseos | grep 'Filesystem created:'

Filesystem created:       Sat Nov 24 03:15:04 2018

Method-2: How To Find Out Linux Operating System (OS) Installation Date And Time Using dumpe2fs Command?
   The dumpe2fs prints the super block and blocks group information for the filesystem present on
   device.

   First we need to identify the device name of the /
   partition. It can be done in many ways but i prefer to go with df Command.

# df -P /

Filesystem                      1024-blocks    Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/mapper/vg_2daygeek-lv_root    27228028 5319516  21630588      20% /

   Then run the tune2fs command to find out Linux Operating System (OS) Installation Date And Time.
# dumpe2fs /dev/mapper/vg_2daygeek-lv_root | grep 'Filesystem created:'

dumpe2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
Filesystem created:       Fri Jun 29 22:15:34 2018

   Use the following combination to check Linux Operating System (OS) Installation Date And Time in
   single command.
# baseos=$(df -P / | tail -1 | cut -d" " -f1) && dumpe2fs $baseos | grep 'Filesystem created:'

dumpe2fs 1.45.3 (14-Jul-2019)
Filesystem created:       Sat Nov 24 03:15:04 2018

Method-3: How To Find Out Linux Operating System (OS) Installation Date And Time Using ls Command?
   ls command is used to list the directory contents. It's a very basic command, which is most
   frequently used by Linux administrator.

   The following combinations will help you to check Linux Operating System (OS) Installation Date And
   Time.
# ls -lact --full-time /etc | tail -1 | awk '{print $6,$7}'

Method-4 (It Works only on RPM Based Systems): How To Find Out Linux Operating System (OS) Installation
Date And Time Using basesystem Command?

   Basesystem defines the components of a basic Red Hat Enterprise Linux system (for example, the
   package installation order to use during bootstrapping). Basesystem should be in every installation
   of a system, and it should never be removed.
