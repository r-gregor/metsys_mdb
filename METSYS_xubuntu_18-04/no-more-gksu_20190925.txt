gksu Removed From Ubuntu, Here's The Recommended Replacement
August 1, 2018

Ubuntu 18.04 no gksu
The gksu package, which provides GTK+ front-ends for su (gksu) and sudo (gksudo), was removed from the
Ubuntu 18.04 repositories (and Linux Mint 19 Tara), so it won't be available starting with this Ubuntu release.

gksu is used to allow elevating your permissions when running graphical applications, for example in case you
want to run a graphical text editor as root to edit a system file, or to be able to remove or add a file to a system folder.

How to edit system files using a GUI without gksu?

Enter admin://. The recommended way of performing operations that require elevated permissions using a GUI is
by using the gvfs admin backend, which is available in both Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (and Linux Mint 19 Tara) and 17.10,
by using the admin:// prefix.

All you have to do is open Nautilus (or Nemo), press Ctrl + L so you can type in its address bar,
and type admin:// followed by the path of the folder containing the file you want to edit, and enter your
password. After doing this, you can use any GUI application to alter system files, like Nautilus to
add / delete files or folders, Gedit (or Xed in Linux Mint 19) to edit text file, and so on.

admin instead of gksu ubuntu
Here's an example. Let's say you want to edit the Grub file. Instead of using gksu gedit /etc/default/grub,
you can open Nautilus / Nemo and type: admin:///etc/default. You'll be asked for your password and after you
enter it, you can open the grub file with Gedit (or Xed in Linux Mint 19), then save it.

Note that there are 3 forward slashes after admin: because 2 are required by default and the 3rd is from the
path that follows, which begins with a slash: /etc/default. One more thing: in Nautilus, don't enter the direct
path to a file but to a folder containing the file you want to edit.

In the same way you can run Gedit from a terminal to open a system file and edit it, for example:

    gedit admin:///etc/default/grub

This will prompt for your password and then open the file in Gedit, allowing you to edit it.

gksu hasn't been maintained for many years and was only left to rot in the Ubuntu repository because some
programs unfortunately still depended on it. Such programs have been migrating to PolKit's pkexec.

Your examples of Synaptic, GParted and Update Manager all use pkexec now (if they didn't already before).
PolKit allows for finer level of control than was possible with gksu. No longer does the entire program need
to run as root.

In short; removing gksu doesn't meaningfully affect users of Ubuntu or Linux Mint, aside from making their
systems safer.

As for editing system configuration files: aside from pkexec, gvfs now has builtin support for
admin:// paths that automatically invoke PolKit as needed. So you can open Nautilus and press Ctrl+L and type
the path admin:///etc/default to open the /etc/default directory with required elevated privileges.
Opening a file from there with Gedit also opens that file with required elevated privileges. From the command
line you can also use the admin:// paths so you could do gedit admin:///etc/default/grub to directly open
/etc/default/grub for editing with Gedit. I guess that admin:// paths should also work with Linux Mint's
developed software on Linux Mint 19 but I haven't tested that yet.
